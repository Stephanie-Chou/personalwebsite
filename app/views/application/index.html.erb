					<p> &emsp; I recently graduated from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign with a degree in Electrical Engineering. Seven year old me wanted to be a paleontologist and could give my family a personalized tour of the dinosaur exhibits at the Chicago Field Museum. I eventually decided to pursue a degree in engineering because I believed the idea that engineers can 'do anything.'</p>
					<p>&emsp;My free time is spent designing and redesigning this website and applying for jobs all while listening to Harry Potter audiobooks (read by the great Jim Dale) with unhealthy repetition. </p>
					<p>&emsp;I recently completed 19 weeks of intensive web development coursework at Dev Bootcamp. I am seeking the opportunity to grow as a developer in an entry-level position.</p>

				     Dev Bootcamp final 8 day project. Web application news feed which brings together differing sides of the story.  Uses Google News scraper and the Alchemy API for natural language processing. Wrote a program which compared scraped news articles based on their keywords and sentiment and displayed the maximally dissimilar articles as pairs, giving users multiple perspectives on the major issues of the day. On our frontend, we used a combination of React and D3.js to create a interactive user interface and visualize user data.
